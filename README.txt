cog_comm_tools - developed by Brian A. Armstrong for the Cognition and Communications lab at the University of Texas at Austin.

ABOUT
cog_comm_tools is a middle-ware package taking advantage of Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) to streamline the programming of psycho-linguistic research in MATLAB.  

The purpose of this middle-ware package is to make programming --possibly complicated -- computerized experiments with as little MATLAB code as possible, using a library of functions with easy to understand English names.

Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 (http://psychtoolbox.org/) contains many useful tools with many options.  cog_comm_tools restricts the functionality and provides a simple interface for non-programmers (research assistants without computer science degrees or programming experience).

The code base is well commented and comes with several examples to help train experimental programmers.

HOW TO USE
(You must have both Matlab R2010 and Psychophysics Toolbox Version 3 installed.)

This folder is an example experiment folder (Matlab code folder) to use with cog_comm_tools.

You can rename the parent folder to MYEXPERIMENTNAME and use this folder for developing your own experiment.

See the _example.m MATLAB scripts for some example function usage. (You can select CHANGE TO FOLDER in Matlab when executing a script to make your experiment folder the ‘current’ folder.)

The actual MATLAB package code is contained in the +cog_comm_tools folder.

See the ExampleExperiment_experiment.m for an example of an entire (simple) experiment that uses the code.

CITING
You should cite cog_comm_tools and PTB if you publish a manuscript for an experiment using cog_comm_tools.

"We wrote our experiment in Matlab, using the cog_comm_tools package by Brian A. Armstrong (available at https://github.com/brianarmstrong/cog_comm_tools) which uses the Psychophysics Toolbox extensions (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997; Kleiner et al, 2007)."
